This is a simple, dark theme, random quote generator. You can:
* tweet the quote you like
* get a new random quote
* reach my code using a button
   

Some new ideas (done)
* Dark theme
* See code button
   
More ideas (todo)
* Different quote on each click.
* Dark/light theme switch button.
* Using a self-made proxy (need to learn Nodejs first)
   
You can checkout my project here: [Quote Generator](https://the-localhost.github.io/quote-generator/).  

This project is inspired from [this](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/) course. 

## NOTE:
The project hosted at above link is not functioning correctly due to issue with proxy.  
Feel free to fork/clone the code and run on local machine.
